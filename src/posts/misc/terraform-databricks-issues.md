# Troubleshooting Common Terraform and Databricks Integration Errors

Integrating Terraform with Databricks can streamline infrastructure deployment, but there are common issues that can ariseâ€”especially when using Azure Managed Identities (MSI) for authentication. This document will keep track of the problems I come across.

## 1. `context deadline exceeded` on `169.254.169.254`

**Error:**

```
Error: cannot read group: failed during request visitor: inner token: token request: Get "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&client_id=0a000000-a0a0-0aa0-a0a0-0a0a0aa0aa00&resource=0aa0a0a0-0a00-0aa0-a0a0-a0a0a0a0a0a0": context deadline exceeded
```

**Root Cause:**

This error occurs when Terraform attempts to authenticate to Azure using a Managed Identity, but fails to reach the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) endpoint (`169.254.169.254`), which is only accessible from within an Azure-hosted environment (e.g., virtual machines or hosted agents).

**Resolution:**

Ensure Terraform is being executed within an Azure-hosted environment. Running Terraform from a local machine or outside Azure will not allow access to IMDS, and the MSI flow will fail. Running the same Terraform configuration from an Azure VM or pipeline agent should resolve this issue.
